# Firefly Home

## What is Firefly? 

Firefly is an opensource home automation system. It is light weight and can run off of a rasberryPi. The python based framework allows for easy development of apps and new components. Using this advanced framework Firefly is able to do complex actions in different scenarios.

Actions can be based off of time of day, if the sun is up, who is home, sensor state and anything else you can imagine!

For example my Hue lights fade from an orange to a daylight white either before my alarm goes off, or if its my day off, when the sun comes up. After I wake up the lights and the level of them are based off of a light sensor in each room, if its cloudy the lights are at 100%, if its sunny they are off, or if its partly cloudy they may be at 50%. At sunset the lights start to fade from the daylight white to a soft white and as it get closer to bedtime they go to a candle light. This is only one example of what can be done with Firefly.

Firefly has an open API that makes it easy to integrate with other systems allowing for seamless interactions such as the included ha-bridge functionality.
